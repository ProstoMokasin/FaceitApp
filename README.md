# Faceit Bot

The Ultimate Faceit Discord bot üí™

## Description

Hi üëã, and welcome to our place. 

I'm [MOKA](), and I will tell you everything about the bot.

First of all this is a community bot, so if you are very enthusiastic about our projects, then be sure to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8XWrVCZQZX) and drop your idea when chatting w/ us üòä

As a CS:GO player myself, I was always playing matches and thinking about how much time will it take me to reach lvl 10. Then I thought of a way to actually see this information without always going on random websites, but also show it to my friends so they can tryhard with me.

And now we have a bot that can predict how much time it will take to get your cherished 2000+ ELO üéâüéâüéâ

## Installation

Use the [**Invite**](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=973146136850366474&scope=bot&permissions=8) link to get the Faceit Bot on your server.

## Usage

You will be able to write a **!faceit Your_Faceit_Nick** in any channel:

**NOTE:**
If you get a **message** back saying **"Loading, please wait üôè"**, then the bot found your faceit account and is requesting information to Faceit API. **If there was no message, then you typed the username incorrectly.**

### <2000 ELO response

When everything has been processed, then you get this information:

### 2000+ ELO response

If you otherwise have more than 2000+ ELO, then the stats will look like this:

### Parts Explained

#### Top

This part shows the user his faceit ELO with his appropriate level.

After it, you can see an ELO scale, that is used on mostly every Faceit Stats third-party website.

**NOTE:** The scale is **not working properly on mobile**, as it is mainly based on gamers that play on PC, and not mobile games

####  Average Stats

![Average stats](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/561946340083499015/978334212421738526/unknown.png)

Here are all the stats from the last 10 matches that you want to flex to your friends on Discord.

#### ELO Predictions

![ELO Predictions](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/561946340083499015/978334572238471178/unknown.png)

This is the new stat that no one has on their website. Here you have match predictions to reach a specific ELO threshold. *This is calculated by your last 10 match winrate*
